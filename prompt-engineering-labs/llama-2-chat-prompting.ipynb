    "* **max_new_tokens:** Model generates text until the output length (excluding the input context length) reaches max_new_tokens. If specified, it must be a positive integer.\n",
    "* **temperature:** Controls the randomness in the output. Higher temperature results in output sequence with low-probability words and lower temperature results in output sequence with high-probability words. If `temperature` -> 0, it results in greedy decoding. If specified, it must be a positive float.\n",
    "* **top_p:** In each step of text generation, sample from the smallest possible set of words with cumulative probability `top_p`. If specified, it must be a float between 0 and 1.\n",

    "***\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- If `max_new_tokens` is not defined, the model may generate up to the maximum total tokens allowed, which is 4K for these models. This may result in endpoint query timeout errors, so it is recommended to set `max_new_tokens` when possible. For 7B, 13B, and 70B models, we recommend to set `max_new_tokens` no greater than 1500, 1000, and 500 respectively, while keeping the total number of tokens less than 4K.\n",
    "- In order to support a 4k context length, this model has restricted query payloads to only utilize a batch size of 1. Payloads with larger batch sizes will receive an endpoint error prior to inference.\n",
    "- This model only supports 'system', 'user' and 'assistant' roles, starting with 'system', then 'user' and alternating (u/a/u/a/u...).\n",

    "#### One-shot Prompting\n",
    "- Involves showing the model a single example to guide its response.\n",
    "- Used to nudge the model in the right direction without overwhelming it.\n",
    "- Helps the model generate natural language text with a limited amount of input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Few-shot Prompting\n",
    "- Involves providing a few labeled exampples in the prompt.\n",
    "- Offers multiple examples, allowing the model to learn from various instances.\n",
    "- Beneficial for dealing with complex tasks, where providing a range of examples helps the model better understand the desired outcome.\n"

      ">>>> Assistant:  The Mexican-American War, also known as the Mexican War, was a conflict fought between the United States and Mexico from 1846 to 1848. The primary cause of the war was the United States' desire to expand its territory and acquire new lands, particularly the disputed region of Texas.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the early 1800s, Texas was part of Mexico, but it had been colonized by the United States, and many of its residents were American. In 1836, Texas declared independence from Mexico and became the Republic of Texas. Mexico refused to recognize Texas' independence, and the two countries remained at odds over the territory.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 1840s, the United States government, led by President James K. Polk, began to pressure Mexico to sell or cede Texas to the United States. Mexico refused, and tensions between the two countries escalated. In April 1846, the United States launched a military invasion of Mexico, which led to the outbreak of war.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary causes of the Mexican-American War can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The dispute over Texas: The United States had long been interested in acquiring Texas, which it saw as a valuable addition to its territory. Mexico, however, refused to sell or cede the territory to the United States.\n",
      "2. Economic interests: The United States was interested in expanding its trade and commerce with Mexico, and saw the acquisition of Texas as a way to gain access to new markets and resources.\n",
      "3. Manifest Destiny: Many Americans believed in the concept of Manifest Destiny, which held that the United States was destined to expand its territory across North America. The acquisition of Texas and other lands in Mexico was seen as a way to fulfill this destiny.\n",
      "4. Political and strategic interests: The United States government was also interested in expanding its political and strategic influence in the region. By acquiring Texas and other lands, the United States could gain a foothold on the Mexican coast and establish a strategic military presence in the region.\n",
      "\n",

      "The primary cause of the Mexican-American War was the United States' desire to expand its territory and acquire new lands, particularly the disputed region of Texas. The United States had long been interested in acquiring Texas, which it considered to be part of its manifest destiny. In 1845, the United States Congress voted to annex Texas as a state, despite Mexico's opposition. Mexico considered Texas to be a rebellious province that had seceded illegally, and it refused to recognize the annexation. This led to a declaration of war by Mexico on April 25, 1846, which the United States quickly accepted. The war lasted for approximately 18 months and ended with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo on February 2, 1848, in which Mexico ceded a large portion of its territory, including present-day California, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and parts of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Wyoming, to the United States.\n",

      "\n",
      "The pressure of an ideal gas, P, is directly proportional to the number of molecules in the container and inversely proportional to the volume of the container. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n",

      "P = nRT/V\n",

      "Now, let's consider what happens to the pressure of an ideal gas if the temperature is increased by a factor of 2 and the volume is increased by a factor of 8.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's analyze the effect of temperature increase:\n",
      "\n",
      "As the temperature of the gas increases, the kinetic energy of the molecules also increases. This means that the molecules are moving faster and are more widely spaced out. As a result, the number of molecules in the container (n) increases, leading to an increase in the pressure of the gas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's analyze the effect of volume increase:\n",
      "\n",
      "As the volume of the container increases, the number of molecules in the container (n) remains constant. This means that the pressure of the gas (P) will decrease as the volume of the container increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if the temperature of the gas is increased by a factor of 2 and the volume is increased by a factor of 8, the pressure of the gas will decrease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the ideal gas equation (P = nRT/V), we can calculate the new pressure of the gas:\n",
      "\n",
      "P1 = n1RT/V1 = n2RT/V2\n",
      "\n",
      "where n1 and V1 are the number of molecules and volume of the gas before the temperature increase and volume increase, and n2 and V2 are the number of molecules and volume of the gas after the temperature increase and volume increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solving for P2 (the new pressure of the gas), we get:\n",
      "\n",
      "P2 = P1 / (V1 / V2) = P1 / (8 / 2) = P1 / 4\n",

This allows the system to perform dynamic reasoning to create, maintain, and adjust plans for acting while also enabling interaction to external environments (e.g., Wikipedia) to incorporate additional information into the reasoning. The figure below shows an example of ReAct and the different steps involved to perform question answering."

      "1. Nuku'alofa: As the capital and largest city of Tonga, Nuku'alofa has a population of around 60,000 people and covers an area of approximately 12 square kilometers (4.6 square miles).\n",
      "2. Neiafu: Located on the island of Vava'u, Neiafu has a population of around 3,000 people and covers an area of approximately 2 square kilometers (0.77 square miles).\n",
      "3. Ha'apai: Located on the island of Ha'apai, Ha'apai has a population of around 2,000 people and covers an area of approximately 1.5 square kilometers (0.58 square miles).\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on these observations, the largest city in Tonga is Nuku'alofa, with a population of around 60,000 people and an area of approximately 12 square kilometers (4.6 square miles).\n",
